In recent years, the landscape of education has transformed significantly with the rise of digital learning platforms. These platforms, including well-known names like Udemy, Coursera, and edX, have democratised access to education, allowing learners worldwide to gain knowledge and skills from experts in various fields and Open-source platforms like Moodle are primarily used by institutions. However, despite their widespread adoption, several challenges persist that hinder the optimal use and effectiveness of these platforms for both educators and students.
One of the critical issues identified is the complexity involved in the course creation process on these platforms. New instructors often find the requirements and processes daunting, which can discourage potential educators from sharing their expertise. Additionally, the stringent quality review processes necessitate a level of technical expertise and time commitment that many freelance teachers may lack. Consequently, this barrier to entry can limit the diversity and range of courses available to students.
For students, the experience is often marred by a lack of personalised attention and support. With courses enrolling thousands of students, it becomes challenging for instructors to provide individualised feedback or address specific learner needs effectively ,also open source platforms like Moodle do not provide a platform for freelancers to create modules and make them visible to students globally. This large class size also impacts the timely provision of assistance and the overall engagement of students with the course material.
